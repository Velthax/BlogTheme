cd BlogTheme

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

Locate the Theme File:
Inside the cloned/downloaded repository, find the main XML file i.e Theme V1.xml. This file contains the entire theme code.

Upload to Blogger:

Go to your Blogger dashboard.

Navigate to Theme.

Click on the Customize dropdown button (usually next to "Live on Blog") and select Restore.

Click Upload and choose the theme V1.xml (or equivalent) file from your downloaded repository.

Confirm the upload.

Clear Browser Cache:
After uploading, it's a good idea to clear your browser's cache to ensure the new theme loads correctly.

üí° Usage
Once the theme is installed, you can start customizing it to fit your specific needs.

Customizing the Theme
Blogger Theme Designer:

From your Blogger dashboard, go to Theme.

Click on Customize.

Here you can change colors, fonts, background images, and adjust various layout options provided by the theme. Experiment with the settings to achieve your desired look.

Editing HTML (Advanced):
For more advanced customizations, you can directly edit the theme's HTML:

From your Blogger dashboard, go to Theme.

Click on the Customize dropdown and select Edit HTML.

Caution: Make a backup of your theme before making direct HTML edits. Incorrect changes can break your blog's layout.

Adding New Posts
When writing new posts, you can utilize standard Markdown or HTML for your content. The theme includes specific styling for <blockquote>  </blockquote>(quote) elements to make them visually prominent.

Example of a Quote in your Post:

<p>This is some regular paragraph text.</p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúReality bends for those who don‚Äôt ask permission.‚Äù</p>
  <cite>‚Äî Vaidik, The Mythic Architect</cite>
 </blockquote>

<p>More content follows the quote.</p>



Note: The theme provides default styling for blockquotes. You can further customize this in the Blogger Theme Designer or by editing the HTML.
